## Pre-trained Models for SNLI dataset
_Note: We provide a series of pre-trained *Optimus* models of for different purpose, due to a trade-off between reconstruction capacity and prior regularization._

```bash
wget https://chunylcus.blob.core.windows.net/machines/msrdl/optimus/$MODEL_DIR/$MODEL_NAME.zip
unzip $MODEL_NAME.zip -d $MODEL_NAME
```
`MODEL_DIR` and `MODEL_NAME` could be different values. We currently release the following models;


Play with our [`demo`](http://40.71.23.172:8899/), including sentence interpolation and analogy.

## A model with good latent space manipulation performance on SNLI dataset. 

To download a model checkpoint with different beta values in VAE, please download the following link. The checkpoints are on Azure Storage Blob, a SAS with Read permission is used.

### Play with user input sentences

The main training script is [`run_latent_generation.py`](../code/examples/big_ae/run_latent_generation.py) and conducts the fine-tuning loop, taking the following options (among others) as arguments:

- `--interact_with_user_input`: it specifies the program will take user inputs
- `--play_mode`: Two modes are supported: [`analogy`, `interpolation`]
- `--sent_source` and `--sent_target`: the source and target sentences to interpolate in between, or to make an analogy
- `--num_interpolation_steps`: the number of interpolated sentences between source and target sentences 
- `--sent_input`: the input sentence that will be re-written with the analogy specified by the source and target sentences
- `--degree_to_target`: (float type), the degree to which the analogy will made, default value is 1.0. 

Here are two examples:
